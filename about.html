    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>
        I'm a rising senior majoring in Computer Science at Skidmore College. 
        I am first and foremost a problem solver. 
        One of the things I love about working with computers is that there is always something new to solve or discover.
        Over the past few years, I've worked with React Native, Flask, and Git.
        I am familiar with several languages like Java, Python, C++, and Swift.
