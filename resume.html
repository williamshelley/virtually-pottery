    <p>
      I've spent the past 3 years expanding my programming and technical capabilities. I have recently taken the time to
      focus on React Native, allowing me to design and develop cross platform mobile Applications. While I am excited to
      continue learning with my coursework, I hope to gain experience on a professional engineering team.
